# 🔹 What is `cdk bootstrap`?

`cdk bootstrap` prepares your AWS account & region so that CDK can deploy resources there.

It creates a special CloudFormation stack called:

```
CDKToolkit
```

In your case:

```
aws://339712902352/ap-south-1
```

So your **Account = 339712902352**
Region = **ap-south-1 (Mumbai)**

# 🔹 Why is Bootstrapping Needed?

When you run:

```
cdk deploy
```

CDK needs a place to:

* Upload Lambda code
* Upload Docker images
* Store CloudFormation templates
* Assume deployment roles
* Store metadata

Without bootstrap → CDK cannot deploy assets.

---

# 🔹 What Exactly Got Created?

Based on your output, CDK created:

---

## 1️⃣ S3 Bucket (StagingBucket)

Used to store:

* Lambda zip files
* CloudFormation templates
* Other file assets

---

## 2️⃣ ECR Repository (ContainerAssetsRepository)

Used when you deploy:

* Docker images
* ECS containers
* Lambda container images

---

## 3️⃣ IAM Roles

Several roles were created:

* `CloudFormationExecutionRole`
* `DeploymentActionRole`
* `FilePublishingRole`
* `ImagePublishingRole`
* `LookupRole`

These allow CDK to:

* Deploy stacks
* Upload assets
* Look up existing resources
* Publish Docker images

---

## 4️⃣ SSM Parameter

`CdkBootstrapVersion`

Stores bootstrap version info.

---

# 🔹 Architecture View

When you run:

```
cdk deploy
```

Flow becomes:

```
Your CDK App
     ↓
CDK CLI
     ↓
S3 (upload assets)
     ↓
CloudFormation
     ↓
IAM Roles execute deployment
     ↓
Resources created
```

---

# 🔹 When Do You Need to Run Bootstrap?

You must run it:

* First time using CDK in an account
* First time in a new region
* When upgrading bootstrap version

You do NOT need to run it every time.

---

# 🔹 What If You Don’t Bootstrap?

You'll get error like:

```
This stack uses assets, so the environment must be bootstrapped.
```

---

# 🔹 Is It One-Time?

Yes.

For each:

```
Account + Region combination
```

Example:

* ap-south-1 → bootstrap once
* us-east-1 → bootstrap separately

---

# 🔹 In Your Case

This line confirms success:

```
✅ Environment aws://339712902352/ap-south-1 bootstrapped.
```

Now you can safely run:

```
cdk deploy
```

# 🔥 Interview-Ready Answer

If someone asks:

**What is CDK bootstrap?**

You can say:

> CDK bootstrap prepares an AWS account and region by creating a CDKToolkit CloudFormation stack that provisions S3 buckets, ECR repositories, and IAM roles required for CDK deployments.
